	<h2>Description</h2>
	<p>Lasagna (plural “lasagne”) is a flat and expanded pasta sheet, traditionally made in Italy with Parmigiano-Reggiano 
		(Parmesan cheese), Béchamel sauce (white sauce), and ragù (a meat-based sauce). Despite the traditional form still 
		being popular, lasagna has taken on many different recipes over the years. The dish is made by stacking lasagna 
		sheets on top of each other with meats, vegetables, cheeses, and tomato sauce between. It is then baked before 
		being served.</p>

	<h2>Ingredients</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Ground beef</strong> - We used 80/20 beef (20% fat content) for a juicier lasagna.</li>
		<li><strong>Onion </strong>- we use yellow onion, or sweet onion works well</li>
		<li><strong>Garlic cloves </strong>- you can add more if you love garlic</li>
		<li><strong>Red wine (or beef broth)</strong> - This amps up the flavor of your sauce (avoid using cooking wine).</li>
		<li><strong>Marinara sauce </strong>- Use homemade marinara or store-bought.</li>
		<li><strong>Dried thyme </strong>- Italian seasoning, basil, or oregano can be substituted</li>
		<li><strong>Sugar </strong>- balances the acidity of the tomatoes</li>
		<li><strong>Parsley </strong>- flat-leaf or curly parsley works well</li>
		<li><strong>Lasagna noodles </strong>- Cook these al dente; they'll continue to soften as the lasagna bakes.</li>
		<li><strong>Cottage cheese </strong>- adds great texture and moisture</li>
		<li><strong>Ricotta cheese </strong>- we use low-fat or part-skim ricotta</li>
		<li><strong>Mozzarella cheese </strong>- An Italian cheese blend works, but mozzarella is definitely the classic choice</li>
		<li><strong>Egg </strong> - helps hold the cheese layer together</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Steps</h2>
	<ol>
		<li><strong>Brown the beef </strong> - Add oil to a deep pan and sautee onion and beef until browned, 5 minutes then add garlic and stir another minute.</li>
		<li><strong>Finish the sauce </strong> - Pour in 1/4 cup of wine and stir until almost evaporated. Add marinara, salt, pepper, thyme, sugar, and parsley; bring to a simmer, then cover and cook 5 minutes.</li>
		<li><strong>Make the cheese filling </strong> - Combine all of the cheese sauce ingredients and 1 cup of mozzarella in a mixing bowl (reserve the rest for later).</li>
		<li><strong>Prep </strong> - Preheat your oven to 375ºF and cook the lasagna noodles in a pot of well-salted water until al dente.</li>
		<li><strong>Assemble </strong> - Spread 1/2 cup of the meat sauce on the bottom of a 9x13-inch casserole dish. Add 3 noodles, followed by 1/3 of the meat sauce, 
			1 cup of mozzarella, and half of the ricotta mixture. Repeat, then for the top layer, add 3 noodles, 1/3 of the meat sauce, and the remaining mozzarella.</li>
		<li><strong>Bake</strong> - Cover with foil and bake at 375˚F for 45 minutes, then remove the foil and broil for 3 to 5 minutes, or until the cheese is lightly browned.</li>
		<li><strong>Rest</strong> - Let the lasagna rest for about 30 minutes before cutting and serving. </li>
	</ol>
